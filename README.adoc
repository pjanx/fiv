fastiv
======

'fastiv' is a fast image viewer, supporting BMP, PNG, GIF, JPEG, and optionally
RAW and SVG pictures, or whatever gdk-pixbuf loads.  Currently, it's very basic.

Non-goals
---------
 - fancy UI--the focus is on speed of use first, colour accuracy second
 - memory efficiency, though preloading can cause some pressure
 - portability to non-UNIXy systems

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR.

Runtime dependencies: gtk+-3.0, glib>=2.64, pixman-1, shared-mime-info,
