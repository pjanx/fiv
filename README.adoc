fastiv
======

'fastiv' is a fast image viewer, supporting BMP, PNG, GIF, JPEG, and optionally
RAW pictures.

It is meant to be a viable replacement for Eye of GNOME, which is slow and likes
to break on huge pictures.  Memory efficiency is specifically a non-goal.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: Meson, pkg-config +
Runtime dependencies: gtk+-3.0, libturbojpeg, LibRaw (optional)

 $ git clone --recursive https://git.janouch.name/p/fastiv.git
 $ meson builddir
 $ cd builddir
 $ meson compile

To install the application, you can do:

 # meson install
