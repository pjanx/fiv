<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><i>fiv</i> is a general-purpose image browser and viewer. This document will
guide you through the application and help to familiarize you with it.

<h2>Controls</h2>

<p><i>fiv</i> is designed with computer mice having dedicated forwards/backwards
and page up/down buttons in mind, such as SteelSeries Sensei series. Ozone Neon
series may also be mapped this way. Your experience may be degraded with other
kinds of devices.

<p>Controls should generally be accessible through the keyboard. Pressing
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&#8239;+&#8239;<kbd>?</kbd> will give you a convenient overview
of all shortcuts. In addition to these, remember that you may often use
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&#8239;+&#8239;<kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>F6</kbd> to navigate to
different groups of widgets.

<h2>Browser</h2>

<p><i>fiv</i> normally starts in a file browser view. On the left side of the
window, you'll find your GTK+ bookmarks, mounted locations as recognized by
GVfs, an item for entering arbitrary filesystem paths or URIs, and finally
breadcrumbs leading to the currently opened directory, as well as descendants
of it.  At the top, there is a toolbar with view controls.

<p>You can open items in a new window either by middle clicking on them, or with
the left mouse button while holding the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.
Right clicking the directory view offers a context menu for opening files,
or even the directory itself, in a different application.

<h2>Viewer</h2>

<p>The image viewer may be both entered (so long as you have a file selected)
and exited using the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. This way you may easily switch
between the two modes. When using the mouse, the forwards and backwards buttons
will fulfill the same function.

<p>Double clicking the image switches full-screen view, and the mouse wheel
adjusts the zoom level.

<p>Files are iterated in the same order, and using the same filtering as in
the browser.

<h2>File formats</h2>

<p>The list of all supported file formats may be obtained by running:

<pre>
fiv --list-supported-media-types
</pre>

<p>Unless it has been turned off in your installation, you may extend it through
gdk-pixbuf modules.

<h2>Thumbnails</h2>

<p><i>fiv</i> uses a custom means of storing thumbnails, and doesn't currently
invalidate this cache automatically. Should you find out that your
<i>~/.cache/thumbnails</i> directory is taking up too much space, run:

<pre>
fiv --invalidate-cache
</pre>

<p>to trim it down. Alternatively, if you want to get rid of <i>all</i>
thumbnails, even for existing images:

<pre>
rm -rf ~/.cache/thumbnails/wide-*
</pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The few configuration options <i>fiv</i> has can be adjusted using
<i>dconf-editor</i>, which can be launched in the appropriate location from
within the application by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&#8239;+&#8239;<kbd>,</kbd>.
For command line usage, there is the <i>gsettings</i> utility:

<pre>
gsettings list-recursively name.janouch.fiv
</pre>

<p>To make your changes take effect, restart <i>fiv</i>.

<h3>Theming</h3>

<p>The standard means to adjust the looks of the program is through GTK+ 3 CSS.
As an example, to tightly pack browser items, put the following in your
<i>~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css</i>:

<pre>
fiv-browser { -FivBrowser-spacing: 0; padding: 0; border: 0; margin: 0; }
</pre>

<p>Similarly, you can adjust some of the key bindings, as per the command table
in the <i>fiv-view.h</i> source file:

<pre>
@binding-set ViewBindings { bind 'p' { 'command' (print) }; }
fiv-view { -gtk-key-bindings: ViewBindings; }
</pre>

<p>Should you want to experiment, you will find the GTK+ inspector very helpful.

<script>
var toc = '', all = document.querySelectorAll('h2')
for (var i = 0; i < all.length; i++) {
	var name = all[i].innerHTML.replace(/[^0-9a-z]/ig, '-')
	toc += '<li><p><a href="#' + name + '">' + all[i].innerHTML + '</a></li>'
	all[i].id = name
	all[i].innerHTML = (i + 1) + '. ' + all[i].innerHTML
}
all[0].insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin',
	'<h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol>' + toc + '</ol>')
</script>
